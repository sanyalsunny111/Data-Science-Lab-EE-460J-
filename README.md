# Data-Science-Lab-EE-460J
This repository conatians the teaching materials created by Sunny as a teaching assistant for Data Science Lab (EE 460J) course taught by Prof. Constantine Caramanis.


# Tutorials
1. [Intro to Bloch Solvers](NoteBooks/Intro_MRI_Bloch_Solvers.ipynb) : This notebooks introduces two ways to simulate the Bloch equations using either standard solvers or solvers assuming periods of free relaxation.
2. [Spoiled Gradient Echo](NoteBooks/Spoiled_Gradient_Echo.ipynb) : This notebook simulates spoiled gradient echo as a means to create contrast in images.
3. [Spin Echo](NoteBooks/Spin_Echo.ipynb) : This notebook simulates spin echo as a means to create contrast in images.
4. [Spatial Selective RF](NoteBooks/Selective_RF_Excitation.ipynb) : This uses sinc pulses to investigate the tradeoffs in RF pulse choices.
5. [Cartesian Sampling](NoteBooks/Simulated_Sampling.ipynb) : This uses real data to examine undersampling and reconstruction.
