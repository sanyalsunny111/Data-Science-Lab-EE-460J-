# Tutorials
1. [Basic python tutorials:](Tutorials/Python Basic Tutorial- Data Science Lab.ipynb) : This notebook introduces basic python cammands, Numpy and Pandas.
2. [Spoiled Gradient Echo](NoteBooks/Spoiled_Gradient_Echo.ipynb) : This notebook simulates spoiled gradient echo as a means to create contrast in images.
3. [Spin Echo](NoteBooks/Spin_Echo.ipynb) : This notebook simulates spin echo as a means to create contrast in images.
4. [Spatial Selective RF](NoteBooks/Selective_RF_Excitation.ipynb) : This uses sinc pulses to investigate the tradeoffs in RF pulse choices.
5. [Cartesian Sampling](NoteBooks/Simulated_Sampling.ipynb) : This uses real data to examine undersampling and reconstruction.
